# CMU_assistant
Course project  Java Application for answering questions all about cmua <hr>
It is course(95-712 Object Oriented Programming in Java) group project, completed by Angie, Sandy, Chen and Nichole(me).<br>
Put it simple, It is a chatbot which can answer questions about CMU australia campus.<br>
Corpus is from CMUA portal https://at.cmu.edu.au/. I get the main content by using web spider(python), and make content into AIML form for programs to match right answers.<br>
AIML files are here: CMU_assistant/CMUA/src/AIML<br>
How to do the chatbotprogram? We got main idea from here https://howtodoinjava.com/ai/java-aiml-chatbot-example/<br> 
We used JavaFX to build GUI, and Google API to realize Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech.
